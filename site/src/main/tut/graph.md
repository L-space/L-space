 ## What is a graph
 A graph is a collection of nodes, edges and values, these are all resources. 
 Nodes can be labelled and nodes can have edges.
 Edges have a 'from' and a 'to' resource which can both be either node, edge or value 
 and the edge is labeled with a key (property). Edges can also have edges.
 Values have a data-value and values can have edges.
 
 ## Creating resources

 ## History
 A graph can have a history trait which means that resources are time aware and 
 annotated with supporting "@createdon" and "@deletedon" tags.
